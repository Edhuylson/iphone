# iPhone Component Modeling and UML Diagram

## Introduction
This project involves modeling and diagramming the representation of an iPhone's roles: Music Player, Phone Device, and Internet Browser, based on the behavior described in the iPhone 2007 launch video.

## Video Reference
- [iPhone 2007 Launch](video-link-here)
  - Relevant Minutes: 00:15 to 00:55

## Diagram and Classes
We'll use a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram to represent the classes and interfaces for the iPhone components. Then, we'll create corresponding Java files.

### Music Player
- Behaviors:
  - Play music
  - Pause music
  - Select music

### Phone Device
- Behaviors:
  - Make calls
  - Answer calls
  - Initiate voice memo

### Internet Browser
- Behaviors:
  - Display web pages
  - Add new tabs
  - Refresh pages

## UML Diagram
You can create the UML diagram using your preferred UML modeling tool. Represent the classes and interfaces for the three components mentioned above with appropriate relationships.

## Java Implementation
Create Java classes and interfaces based on the UML diagram.
